Consumption Token of the DIMO metaverse - ONDO token

Generally, money has four functions:
1. A store of value
2. A medium of exchange
3. A unit of account
4. A standard of deferred payment

According to Bullmann et al. (2019) and the European Central Bank (2019), stablecoins can be classified based on three dimensions using the Crypto-cube Framework: 1) Accountability of Issuer; 2) Decentralisation of Responsibilities; and 3) Value Supported by. Professor Ming-Hwa Hsieh from the Risk and Insurance Research Center at National Chengchi University in Taiwan (2021) categorises stablecoins into four types: 1) Tokenized Funds; 2) Off-chain Collateral; 3) On-chain Collateral; and 4) Algorithmic.

Off-chain Collateral and On-chain Collateral are also known as Asset-collateral/Assetbacked Stablecoins. The initial issuance mechanism of ONDO is based on the start-up funds allocated from DIMO governance/equity tokens, which belong to Tokenized Funds. The subsequent increase in value comes from Asset-collateral/Asset-backed Stablecoins: ONDO tokens are issued in total value equivalent to 1:1 with USDT through platform valuation, physical real estate, ecosystem commodity trading purposes, and merchant platform profit returns (such as transaction fees).

The ONDO consumption token is issued through blockchain smart contracts as a stable currency corresponding to fiat currency. ONDO is first issued and used by storing stable currency through a third-party financial bank. It is primarily used for closed-loop consumption transactions, settled through crypto-tokens, which saves on cross-border financial, tax, and cash flow costs. Additionally, the decentralised, transparent, and highly secure features of smart contracts can help consumers make more transparent choices about their participation in activities and their rights and obligations to consume and use dividend funds.

1) Stable value
A store of value is an asset that keeps its value without significant depreciation over time. Because ONDO is a stablecoin, it is designed to function as a store of value even in a volatile market.

2) Exchangeability
The ONDO consumer token can be used for online and offline consumption, such as binding long-term accommodation contracts, booking cultural and tourism products, and enjoying services. ONDO can be exchanged for other stablecoin or fiat through physical locations and decentralised cryptocurrency DEX exchanges.

3) Dividend issuance
The governance token DIMO and its derivatives have a rebate mechanism, similar to the cash dividend of traditional stocks.

4) Unit of account
The token is not subject to cross-border issues, greatly reducing user exchange costs and merchant settlement costs.

5) Attendance
Direct cross-border attendance is much easier as products and services are automatically listed by merchants. Users can plan theirtrips and avoid past problems with opaque information when travelling across borders for accommodation and experiential services

6) Supervision and auditing
The fully automatic system built on smart contracts ensures that the flow of funds
on-chain is open, transparent, real-time, and secure. After third-party audit units and
public hackathons, the system can be displayed and used with confidence.
